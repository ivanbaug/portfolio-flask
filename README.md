# my-web-portfolio

- A web portfolio with flask and jinja templating.

- The UI imitates the Julia Programming Languaje webpage https://julialang.org/ , took it as reference because it just looks clean and pretty sober.

- ~~Working demo: ~~ Demo is no longer working as I remade the site with a static site generator, you can view the project here: https://github.com/ivanbaug/portfolio-gohugo

- Deployed on GCP's Cloud Run.
